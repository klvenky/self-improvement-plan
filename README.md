# self-improvement-plan

A Self Improvement Plan to keep the imposter in me happy. The objective is to improve myself in multiple areas including & other than coding.

There are multiple areas which I want to improve upon. Few include the following:

1) A plan to improve.
2) Better at programming :wink:
3) A knowledge base for my decisions

### High-level plan
Choice of programming language - [Golang](https://golang.org/)
1) Go Basics
  - default types
  - interfaces
  - file management
  - custom types(probably structs)
  - Generics(not sure if they exist or not)
  - Web Services in Go
2) ShortUrl generator in Go.
3) Improve problem solving approaches
  - Write Algorithms for 1-25 problems in [Euler Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
  - Try solving the above 25 problems in Go
  - Calculate the Time & Space Complexity for each Algorithm written
4) Design Patterns
  - Singleton Pattern 
    - Use cases
    - Examples
  - Factory Pattern 
    - Use cases
    - Examples
5) Gmail API Scraper
 - scrape the emails using an auth key from the env
