# self-improvement-plan

A Self Improvement Plan to keep the imposter in me happy. The objective is to improve myself in multiple areas including & other than coding.

There are multiple areas which I want to improve upon. Few include the following:

1. A plan to improve.
2. Better at programming :wink:
3. A knowledge base for my decisions

### High-level plan

Choice of programming language - [Golang](https://golang.org/)

1. Go Basics

   - default types
   - interfaces
   - file management
   - custom types(probably structs)
   - Generics(not sure if they exist or not)
   - Web Services in Go
   - [TDD in GoLang](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/)

2. Interesting implementations to try out

   - [Sample Network Algorithm](https://dev.to/itsmukulmishra/most-secured-tcp-implementation-k8f)
   - [Recreating standard libraries in go](https://dev.to/rubenwap/upskill-yourself-by-recreating-gnu-coretools-in-go-9f5)

3. ShortUrl generator in Go.
4. Improve problem solving approaches

   - Write Algorithms for 1-25 problems in [Euler Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
   - Try solving the above 25 problems in Go
   - Calculate the Time & Space Complexity for each Algorithm written

5. Design Patterns

   - Singleton Pattern
     - Use cases
     - Examples
   - Factory Pattern
     - Use cases
     - Examples

6. Solve the classic Algorithm Problems

   - Travelling SalesMan problem
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm
   - Graph Algorithms(not sure what all can be there)
